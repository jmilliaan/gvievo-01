"""The MLS track decoders (agv_core/drivers/canbus/read_mls.py), restored for line
following.

TPDO1 is eight bytes: LCP1..LCP3 as 16-bit words, #LCP plus marker in byte 6,
status in byte 7 (SICK 8021642 table 6). The word layout depends on 2006h:01:
Standard is a plain INT16 in mm, Combi packs a 10-bit position and a 6-bit
width. Both are asserted from hand-built frames, not from the decoder's own
output, so a mis-read table shows up as a wrong number here.
