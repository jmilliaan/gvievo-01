"""Line-following controller. Pure computation - no CAN, no Flask, no file I/O.

Control law:

    omega_cmd  = -(Kp*e + Ki*integral + Kd*d_filt)      Kp = K_RATIO * v
    v_cmd      = v_base - speed_reduction
    (N_L, N_R) = body_to_wheels(v_cmd, omega_cmd), then joint saturation

Kp scales with v deliberately. For a sensor mounted Ls ahead of the axle the
error dynamics are  e_dot = v*theta + Ls*omega, and substituting Kp = K_RATIO*v
into the closed-loop damping gives

    zeta = (Kd + Ls*K_RATIO) / (2*sqrt(K_RATIO*(1 + Ls*Kd)))

with no v in it. Damping is therefore the same at 800 r/min and at 2546, which
is what makes commissioning by working the speed up valid rather than a re-tune
at every step. KIM2A reached the same relationship empirically ("KP scales
roughly linearly with target speed").

*** The binding limit on K_RATIO is 6083h, not stability of the ideal plant. ***
The wheel difference cannot slew faster than the drivers ramp, which caps yaw
acceleration at 2*ACCEL*RAD_S_PER_RPM_DIFF = 2.59 rad/s^2 at the present 2000
(r/min)/s. An ideal-plant model says K_RATIO = 100 is optimal; with the real
slew limit that diverges at 0.8 m/s. Raising K_RATIO far requires raising 6083h
with it, and re-checking traction before doing so.

Every constant this file reads comes from config (the vehicle profile). Values
are read at call time, not bound at import, so a test can retarget a gain and
the next tick picks it up.
