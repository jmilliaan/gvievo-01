"""The vehicle profile. Every tunable parameter in the system lives here.

Reads profiles/<name>.json and publishes it as flat module-level constants, so
call sites read `config.TRACK_M` rather than digging through nested dicts.
Everything else imports this; this imports nothing but the standard library,
which is what keeps the dependency graph acyclic.

WHICH VEHICLE
=============
The profile is chosen by the AGV_PROFILE environment variable, falling back to
DEFAULT_PROFILE:

    python3 app.py                      # profiles/agv-01.json
    AGV_PROFILE=agv-02 python3 app.py   # profiles/agv-02.json

and in the systemd unit, Environment=AGV_PROFILE=agv-01. There is no CLI flag
and no fallback to a profile that does not exist - a missing file is fatal and
lists the names that ARE present.

Four rules the loader enforces, in order of how much trouble they save:

  1. Unknown and missing keys are BOTH fatal. A profile with "k_rato" would
     otherwise leave the gain at whatever the code last defaulted to, and the
     vehicle would drive off with a number nobody chose. This is the main thing
     the JSON buys over .py constants and the main way it could bite.
  2. Only primitives are stored. Anything derivable is derived here, so the file
     cannot hold a geometry that disagrees with itself - no MPS_PER_RPM that
     contradicts the wheel diameter it was supposedly computed from.
  3. Validation runs before anything is published. A bad profile stops the
     process at import with the failing check named, rather than surfacing as
     strange behaviour halfway down a length of tape.
  4. profile_name must match the filename. A profile copied for a second
     vehicle and not renamed would report the old identity in the event log and
     in every run CSV header, and nothing would look wrong until two runs were
     compared weeks later.
  5. `tracked` (top level, true/false/null) says which product this vehicle is.
     false = trackless: the SLAM AMR, boots to IDLE, MAPPING/NAVIGATION are
     offered and LINE is refused. true = the magnetic-tape AGV: the supervisor
     enters LINE by itself once the base is up, and NAVIGATION/surveys are
     refused. null = both (2026-10-02): boots to IDLE, every mode is offered,
     and the web shows Run tracked and Run trackless. It is read at boot;
     changing it means restarting amr.service.

load() is written as an atomic swap - parse and validate into a fresh namespace,
publish only on success - so nothing observes a half-applied profile. Only
called once today; a reload endpoint would be a caller, not a rewrite.


TUNING NOTES
============
JSON cannot carry comments, so the reasoning behind the settings that are not
self-evident lives here. Read this before editing a profile.

vehicle.invert_left / invert_right
    Both drivers take a POSITIVE 60FFh to travel forward on this AGV. If you swap
    a motor, re-flash a driver or remount a wheel, re-verify on blocks and set
    these rather than editing kinematics - everything above it stays in vehicle terms.

drivers.ramp
    6083h/6084h, written at arm time. One mode, "auto" (2026-10-02: the "manual"
    block went with canworker - drive_node always arms with this one, and the
    manual S-curve lives in cmd_mux). Set as transparent as is safe, on the
    assumption that the motion profile is shaped in software above it. A STOP
    falls through to this decel rate.
    CAUTION: with a 400 W motor on a gearhead the Function Edition warns the motor
    can be damaged by a hard decel while demand and actual velocity differ a lot
    (opman_fun:2951). This vehicle IS that combination (BLMR6400SKM-GFV-B, 1:30):
    the drives run in motion extension (drive_forward.PVCM_MOTION_EXTENSION), and
    the auto decel should not be raised far above its accel.
    CAUTION (auto): 6083h also caps how fast the wheel DIFFERENCE can slew, so
    it is the ceiling on YAW ACCELERATION as well as on forward ramp -
    kinematics.max_yaw_accel() turns it into rad/s^2 and gives 2.59 at the
    present 2400. A controller that commands a yaw rate the drives cannot slew
    to diverges, so derive the limit from this rather than hardcoding one; and
    raising this without re-checking traction is a different kind of mistake.


timing.manual_watchdog_s
    A held button re-POSTs every ~100 ms. Miss six in a row and the setpoint is
    zeroed - covers a closed tab, a dropped Wi-Fi link and a wedged browser.

    0.6 s rather than the original 0.4: three missed POSTs is tight over Wi-Fi,
    and the trips it produced were the link hiccuping rather than the operator
    letting go. It does not change how fast the vehicle stops when they DO let
    go - the browser sends /api/stop on release and that is immediate; this
    deadline only covers the case where nothing arrives at all.

    Expiry zeroes the setpoint and logs a warning; it does NOT latch a fault.
    Recovery is to hold the button again, which is a deliberate act with a hand
    on the control, so there is nothing for an acknowledgment to add.

    *** An autonomous mode would need the opposite. *** Latched motion that
    would otherwise resume on its own has to latch a fault instead, the way tape
    following did. Whatever navigates next must make that choice deliberately
    rather than inherit this one.

panel.di_manual_arm
    The Manual Arm input (DI08 on agv-01). Under MANUAL the drives are powered
    only while this input is HIGH; LOW leaves them in standby (CANopen up,
    encoders read, power stage off), so a jog, a pendant press, a survey move
    or a commissioning pp move does nothing until it is switched on. Under
    AUTO it is ignored: power follows the run (amr_base/arm_policy.py).

    It replaces manual_auto_arm (the selector in MANUAL was itself the arm
    command, 2026-10-08): the drives are no longer powered while idle.

    *** Power is not motion. *** A powered manual vehicle holds zero; every
    millimetre still needs a jog HELD (manual_watchdog_s). And nothing here can
    power through the safety chain: an FX3 demand leaves the drives in ETO, the
    enable fails, and it is retried on a slow backoff, never latched.

timing.loop_period_s / telemetry_period_s
    50 Hz bus loop; 5 Hz statusword + rpm + error register (6 fast reads).

    *** The telemetry poll is the largest spike in the loop. *** Six blocking
    SDO round-trips at ~1.8 ms each land inside a single 20 ms tick, one tick in
    ten. Measured over tape-following runs 0023-0025 the loop held a p50 of
    20.1 ms but a p95 of 28.1 and a max of 37.9. Lowering this period makes the
    spike more frequent, not smaller; moving the statusword and actual velocity
    onto drive TPDOs is what removes it - see manuals/codebase-improvement.md.

rfid.*  (Chafon CF821, UHF EPC Gen2, TCP 2022)
    CF821 protocol captured from this unit on 2026-10-08 and CRC-verified; the
    framing and command codes are in agv_core/drivers/rfid.py. The reader streams tags on
    its own because its WorkMode is "active" - nothing we send starts it. The
    driver only ever QUERIES the reader (device info, parameters, heartbeat);
    reader settings are changed with the vendor tool, never from this code.

    tag_len is how many trailing EPC bytes form the tag id. Our tags carry a
    4-byte EPC and the route tables use the last 2 ("0020").

    ignore_tags discards ids before they become encounters. It used to hold
    "3130", an artifact of fixed-length framing chewing the device-info reply;
    length + CRC framing cannot produce it, so the list is normally empty.

rfid.heartbeat_s / heartbeat_timeout_s
    heartbeat_s > 0 sends the 0x0050 "online" query that often. Once the reader
    has answered one on a connection, a gap longer than heartbeat_timeout_s
    drops and reconnects the link - that is how a reader wedged behind a live
    TCP stack becomes rfid_comms_lost. A reader that never answers is reported
    once and not asked again. Ships 0 (off) until a bench run confirms the query
    does not interrupt active-mode streaming.

rfid.expect_work_mode / expect_region / expect_power_dbm
    What the reader is SUPPOSED to be configured as. The driver reads the real
    values (0x0072) on every connect and raises a warning event per mismatch -
    a swapped or factory-reset unit shows up on the dashboard. Never a stop.
    work mode 0 answer / 1 active / 2 trigger; region 0 custom / 1 US / 2 Korea /
    3 EU / 4 Japan / 5 Malaysia / 6 EU3 / 7-8 China. The unit shipped on US
    (902.75-927.25 MHz); Indonesia permits 920-923 MHz, which needs region 0.

timing.driver_timeout_s
    How long a driver may go without answering a telemetry read before it is
    declared silent and the vehicle is stopped. This is HARDWARE health and has
    nothing to do with the browser watchdogs above - those cover an absent
    operator, this covers an absent driver.

    Must sit above telemetry_period_s or the ordinary gap between two polls
    reads as a dead driver; _validate() enforces that. 0.6 s is three normal
    polls, which is deliberately generous: the 5 Hz telemetry poll shares the
    bus with setpoint writes, so an occasional late read is expected. Tighten it
    only after watching the event log across several runs.

can.use_rpdo
    Send the controlword and 60FFh as ONE RPDO1 frame per tick instead of a
    blocking SDO write per node. *** Ships FALSE - turn it on only after the
    bench checklist. ***

    60FFh is currently written by a blocking SDO transfer twice a tick, about
    1.8 ms each, against a 20 ms budget the loop already overruns (20.4 ms
    average, 31 ms peak). An RPDO is a bare CAN frame with nothing to wait for,
    so this returns ~3.6 ms of every tick. It is the largest available win on
    the control loop and it is a prerequisite for the ROS drive node, not an
    optimisation - see manuals/slam-generalized-plan/hardware-reconciliation.md
    D-8 and manuals/potential-ros-migration.md section 9.

    An RPDO is not acknowledged, and that is deliberately not a loss: nothing
    ever checked the acknowledgement on the per-tick path, a failed setpoint is
    corrected 20 ms later by the next tick, and what actually detects a drive
    that has gone quiet is health.py fed by the 1017h heartbeat - untouched by
    this. A late tick, by contrast, IS a steering update the vehicle does not
    get.

    A flag rather than a straight replacement because it changes the motion
    path: if the bench finds the drives unhappy with an async RPDO, backing out
    is a profile edit rather than a revert. Both paths stay tested.

can.heartbeat_ms
    Producer heartbeat time (1017h), written to each drive at bus-up. The
    driver default is 0 = OFF, and with it off a drive that has stopped
    responding looks identical to one that is simply idle - which is exactly
    the hole health.py was working around by inferring liveness from whether an
    SDO happened to answer. 200 ms is the plan's recommendation.

    Must be under half timing.driver_timeout_s or one missed heartbeat reads as
    a dead driver; _validate() enforces that. 0 leaves the drive's own setting
    alone.

monitor.*
    Drive health monitoring - see manuals/can-monitoring-plan.txt.

    *** DIAGNOSTIC ONLY. Nothing here may decide whether it is safe to move. ***
    The safety chain is lidar/encoders -> FX3 -> HWTO1/HWTO2 -> STO, in
    hardware. CAN is the channel beside it that records what happened and warns
    before a trip.

    The analogue objects are polled ONE PER NODE per poll, round-robin, and
    poll_period_s paces it. At tick rate that would be two SDO round-trips out
    of every 20 ms budget - about 4 ms of tick and a fifth of a 125 kbps bus -
    for values that move on a thermal timescale. At 0.1 s it is ~0.8 ms of
    average tick and ~4% of the bus, sweeping the whole table in about a
    second. The plan asks for 1-5 Hz on Tier 3; this sits just under it and
    leaves the control loop alone, which matters more.

    Temperature warns are the plan's: driver trips at 85 C so warn at 70, motor
    trips at 95 so warn at 80. Bus voltage is two-sided - low is battery sag
    with stopping distance already degraded, high is regen the battery is
    refusing to take, and the high warn wants to sit well below the drive's
    own 63 V overvoltage trip.

horn.*
    The only output this software energises. One DO drives the horn AND the
    running lights together - one channel, one meaning - and it goes high
    whenever motion is COMMANDED: manual jog or auto run, no distinction,
    because the hazard is the same 150 kg either way and a horn that means two
    different things means neither.

    *** It follows the setpoint, not the wheels. *** The coil is raised from the
    commanded target, so it sounds at the instant motion is asked for rather
    than once the vehicle is already rolling - which is the whole point of a
    warning device. It also means the horn goes quiet while the drives are
    still decelerating, and that is the right way round: the warning ends when
    the vehicle stops being commanded to move, and what remains is a coast that
    is already ending.

    *** Not a safety function. *** The stop is the OSSD chain into the FX3, in
    hardware. This is an audible and visible warning and nothing gates on it: a
    horn that failed to sound must not be able to prevent a jog, or a broken
    lamp becomes a stranded vehicle.

    Renewal, not level. The command carries HORN_HOLD_S and the CAN tick renews
    it every 20 ms; a tick that stops renewing drops the coil at the DIO scan
    rather than leaving it energised. See the derived value.

blind_run.*
    Encoder-only test moves from /blind, to measure the encoders before SLAM
    relies on them. The page only SETS a plan; PB Start runs it, with the
    selector in MANUAL and the vehicle armed. Reset, a selector move, web Stop,
    a fault or lost 6064h feedback stops it. The plan survives a stop so the
    same move can be run again.

    Profile velocity mode with a software position loop: the faster wheel runs
    a trapezoid on its REMAINING counts at accel_rpm_s, capped at max_rpm; the
    other follows the planned ratio plus sync_kp (1/s) times its progress lag.
    A segment ends within stop_tolerance_mm, then waits settle_s at standstill
    before its counts are recorded. Overrunning by overrun_margin, or taking
    twice the planned time, aborts. max_distance_m caps each wheel per segment.

    Nothing steers on a sensor. The IMU yaw rate is written beside the encoder
    heading in the run CSV so the two can be compared afterwards - see imu.* -
    and that is the whole of its involvement.

    max_speed_mps caps the centre-path speed of a blind move on either backend
    (the /commissioning page offers up to this). Above ~0.4 m/s the protective
    field sizing of the nanoScan3/FX3 must be confirmed first; that is a check
    on the vehicle, not something this file can know.

pp.*
    Profile position (CiA 402 pp) blind moves, executed INSIDE the drives: the
    drive's own position loop runs each wheel to a count target. LOCKED by
    default (enabled false). The motor is a 400 W BLM with a 1:30 gearhead, and
    the BLV-R manual (function edition 3-4/3-6) requires motion-extension mode
    for that combination, which no positioning type offers. There is no vendor
    confirmation: enabling pp is an INTERNAL engineering decision to accept
    that risk, bounded by the settings below, the speed cap and a bench test
    on blocks first. vendor_ref records who decided, when and on what basis;
    the loader refuses enabled=true while it is empty.

    expect.* are the values a human sets IN THE DRIVES with MEXE02 (and saves).
    This software never writes them - they are on no allow-list in guard.py -
    it reads them back from both drives before every pp move and refuses on
    any difference, or while any of them is still null:
      max_torque_permille     6072h  caps motor torque so torque x 30 stays
                                     inside the gearhead's permissible torque
      following_error_counts  6065h  how far a wheel may lag before bit 13
      position_window_counts  6067h  "target reached" band
      halt_option             605Dh  Halt decelerates on the profile ramp (1)
      fault_reaction          605Eh  2 = quick-stop ramp (6085h), never 0 on a gear
      quick_stop_decel        6085h  r/min/s
    max_speed_mps is the pp cap, at most blind_run.max_speed_mps.

timing.auto_start_delay_s
    The pre-move warning (2026-10-08): every move that follows an operator's
    Start under AUTO - a run from Home, a station departure, a resume after an
    E-stop or an RFID hold - first powers the drives and sounds the ALARM horn
    for at least this long, then switches to the movement horn and moves. Tape
    (LineState ARMED) and trackless (RunState.premove) alike. A Reset, a
    selector move or a lapsed prerequisite during it cancels the start.
    Holds that resume by themselves (protective field, controller abort) keep
    their power and do not repeat the warning: nobody pressed anything.

timing.premove_timeout_s
    How long the pre-move phase waits for the drives to report Operation
    enabled before the start is refused ("drives did not power up"). Usually
    the safety chain: E-stop pressed or not yet reset. Must exceed
    auto_start_delay_s; the enable retry backoff is 2 s, so give it two tries.

mls.*  (SICK MLS line sensor, can.sensor_node; manuals/mls-marker-plan.md)
    What the sensor is expected to be configured as. drive_node only READS these
    objects and compares; the bench tool read_mls writes them (set-variant,
    set-markers), through guard.check_sensor.

    variant is 2006h:01, the TPDO1 packing (3 = Standard enhanced since
    2026-10-07). A difference is logged and decoded as reported.

    markers_enabled turns marker events on: the sensor's own decoded code
    (2028h, standard mode, FailSafe) becomes /amr/line_marker events. Off until
    the bench session (plan B0-B7) has passed. On, but the sensor not configured
    as below, means NO events and a warning naming the fix - never a guess.
    marker_codes lists the codes laid on the floor (1-3 with the MLSE-0200,
    15 mm markers); any other code read is a reject, counted, never an event.
    polarity_lock expects 202Dh:05 = 1 (only north track seen): leave false until
    a full lap has shown north-up tape everywhere, because south-up track
    becomes invisible with it. teach_lock expects 2029h = 1 (keypad locked).

    Nothing here is in the safety path or changes motion.

imu.*
    The IMU inside the SICK MLS on can.sensor_node, read over SDO by the bus
    thread and shown on /monitor and the rail. DISPLAY ONLY today: nothing
    steers from it, nothing gates on it, and it is not a health source. It is
    here so the gyro can be watched before gyro-odometry is built on it - see
    drivers/canbus/read_imu.py for why the gyro is a navigation component.

    One SDO read per poll, round-robin over eight objects (gyro xyz, accel xyz,
    yaw, the sensor's own clock). A read costs ~4 ms on the 125 kbps bus, so
    reading the whole set at once would eat a 20 ms tick; spreading it keeps
    every tick short and refreshes the whole picture every 8 x poll_period_s.
    At 0.04 s that is ~3 Hz, which is plenty to eyeball. SLAM wants 100 Hz
    yaw rate and will get it from a TPDO (read_imu.py tpdo gyro), routed
    through TpdoTap - not by turning this poll up.

    retry_period_s is the back-off after a read times out. Without it an
    absent or unpowered sensor would cost a timeout on every poll, and the
    timeout (short as it is) is dead time the control loop pays for.

can.channel / can.adapter_serial
    The SocketCAN interface to prefer, and which CANable2 to accept on the USB
    fallback. Per-vehicle hardware identity, so it belongs in the profile rather
    than in canbus/verify_drivers.py where it used to live. adapter_serial ""
    accepts any matching adapter, which is what a bench with one wants.
