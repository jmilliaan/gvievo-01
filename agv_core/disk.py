"""How much room is left to write in (power-loss plan W3).

A full disk is a lost-write problem like a power cut: a map save that runs out of
space mid-bundle is the ugliest failure in the stack. The supervisor refuses new
surveys and saves below the stop threshold, and the operator surface raises the
alarm a gigabyte earlier - but a vehicle that is ALREADY running is never gated
on it, because stopping a moving machine over free space would be the worse
failure.

Lives in agv_core because the supervisor and the web both need the same answer
and neither should import the other's internals.
