"""The operator event log that survives a restart.

The event ring lived only in the web adapter's memory, so every service restart
threw away the reason the vehicle stopped - and "it stopped yesterday" had only
journalctl and base.log as evidence, both engineer-only. This appends every event
to `~/.amr/logs/events.jsonl` and reloads the tail on start, so the Alarms page's
history is still there after a restart, a crash or a power cut.

One line per event, size-rotated (5 MB x 5 files). Nothing here may raise into a
ROS callback: a full disk must not stop the vehicle reporting its state, so every
operation is best-effort and failures are counted, not thrown.
