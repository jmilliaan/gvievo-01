"""The mux's LINE branch: that the tape command wins, and only when it should.

`amr_base.gating.select()` is the last software arbitration point before the
drive owner, and it is pure, so this runs without a ROS graph.

The branch sits on the AUTO side, ABOVE the LEASE_AUTONOMOUS check, because a
LINE lease carries no AUTONOMOUS bit and would otherwise be refused outright.
It sits above the permit machinery too: the follower holds no MotionPermit, it
holds LEASE_LINE and publishes a twist. Both of those are easy to break by
moving the branch, so they are pinned here.
