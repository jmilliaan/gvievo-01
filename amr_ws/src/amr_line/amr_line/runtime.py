"""The configuration namespace the tape engine is HANDED, instead of importing.

`autopilot.py` is a byte-for-byte port from `gy-demo`, where it did
`import config` and got the vehicle profile loader — a module that reads
`profiles/<AGV_PROFILE>.json` from disk at import. A ROS node, a unit test and
the sim all need the same 34 names from three different sources, and a layer
that reads a file at import cannot be constructed twice in one process with two
different vehicles. So the port aliases this module to the name `config`:

    from amr_line import runtime as config      # autopilot.py, line 34

and every `config.K_RATIO` inside the engine lands here. That single alias is
what kept the port's review surface to three lines.

**Nothing here is read at import.** The engine reads every constant at call
time (its own docstring promises this), so `load_from_profile()` need only run
before the first `update()`, not before `import autopilot`.

**This module is deliberately mutable.** `simulate()` in the test rig assigns
`config.AUTO_RPM` around a run and restores it in a `finally`; the ported
`test_control.py` does the same with `K_RATIO` and `KD`. A frozen namespace
would break the rig that proves the gains.

The strictness is in `__getattr__`: an unset name raises with the list of what
to do about it, rather than returning a silent zero. A tape follower that
reads `KD` as 0.0 because a profile key was renamed does not fail — it steers
badly, at speed, on a real vehicle.
