"""LineTrack message -> the sensor dict the ported engine eats, plus freshness.

The engine was written against `canworker._sensor_json()`, a plain dict:

    {"tracks": [{"index": 1, "pos_mm": -30, "width": 10}, ...],
     "has_track": True}

and "no line" is `{"tracks": [], "has_track": False}`. `_read_error` reads only
`"tracks"`, so the shape is small; this module builds it from the ROS message
and answers the two questions the node must ask before every tick.

*** Freshness and RATE are different questions, and both can fail. ***
`sensor_timeout_s` catches a stream that has STOPPED. It cannot see one that is
fresh but slow, and that is the case this vehicle actually has: the MLS SDO
fallback measured 9.8 Hz on 2026-09-19 against a 50 Hz PID. Every sample is
recent, every staleness check passes, and the follower is steering on a
quarter of the information the gains were tuned for. `line_min_track_hz` is
the second gate, and `source == "sdo"` is a third - mls_track's own docstring
says the SDO path is "too slow and too skewed for control".
