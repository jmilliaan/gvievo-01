"""Line-follow authority and state machine. No ROS, no clock, no I/O.

The same split `amr_base/commissioning.py` uses, and for the same reason: the
decisions here are the ones worth testing, and a test that needs a ROS graph
does not get run. The node marshals messages, stamps freshness and owns the
clock; this file decides whether the vehicle may move and hands back a wheel
command. Everything it knows arrives in a frozen `Inputs`.

STATE VALUES ARE ON THE WIRE. They are LineState.msg's constants, and
readiness.py holds `_line_active_locked` as `line_state in (1, 2, 3)` - ARMED,
RUNNING, HOLD. mode_fsm refuses to leave LINE while that is true. ARMED is
reserved on the wire but never entered since 2026-10-07: the physical Start
under AUTO checks the prerequisites and starts the run in one step, so there is
no separate software arm (motor arming is drive_node's, in every mode). Renumbering
these silently breaks the guard that stops a layer swap under a moving
vehicle, so the constants are asserted against the message in the node.

WHAT HOLDS THE VEHICLE, and how each resumes:

  field       protective field violated (/output_paths): resumes by itself
  estop       drive torque gone with the field clear: needs a physical Start,
              unless auto_resume_estop
  drives      wheel feedback or drive report went stale while running: stops
              at once, resumes by itself once feedback is back
  track       no usable tape reading: the ENGINE owns the grace distance, so
              this hold is only for a reading that never arrives at all
  rate        samples are fresh but too slow, or the MLS fell back to SDO.
              sensor_timeout_s cannot see this - see track.TrackReader
  rfid        the RFID stream broke while driving (link down, reconnect,
              buffer overrun) on a mission with tags: a station or the U-turn
              may have been driven past. Needs a physical Start once the link
              is back; during a U-turn it is a FAULT like any other hold
  station     parked at a stop: a physical Start, then auto_start_delay_s
  authority   lease, generation or panel selector changed under the run.
              Never auto-resumes: something above this layer took control.
              An explicit act - the selector leaving AUTO on a valid panel,
              LEASE_LINE withdrawn from a fresh lease, the lease replaced -
              ends the run at once (FAULT, Reset to clear), as the executor's
              manual takeover does. A MISSING signal (stale panel, stale
              lease) is a comms question and goes through the debounce

The asymmetry between debounced and immediate is deliberate and copied from
the executor: a prerequisite must fail CONTINUOUSLY for prereq_grace_s before
it faults, so one dropped frame never latches, but anything that means the
vehicle is moving without proper feedback stops on the first tick. Delaying a
stop is the wrong direction.
