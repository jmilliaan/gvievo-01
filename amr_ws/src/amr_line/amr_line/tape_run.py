"""One LINE run's mission state: the RFID tag table, branches, marker speed zone, stops, U-turn.

Schema v2 (2026-10-08): the mission is the site's tag reference table
(agv_core.mission). Pure: no ROS, no clock of its own, no I/O. FollowJob owns
one, feeds it a frozen RFID snapshot and the follower each tick, and acts on
what it asks for:

    stop          {"kind": "station", "tag", "where", "role", "distance_m"} while
                  a measured stop is in progress or parked at a stop
    uturn_req     {"tag", "direction", "approach_mps", "decel_m", "decel_rpm_s",
                  "max_approach_m", "phase", "travel_m", "level", "gone"} from the
                  U-turn tag until the turn ends. phase: approach (slow to the
                  creep within decel_m, follow until the tape is gone) -> stopping
                  (command zeroed at once) -> the pivot (self.uturn, amr_line.uturn)
    link_lost     why the RFID stream can no longer be trusted while driving
                  (link down, reconnect, buffer overrun): the job holds the
                  vehicle for a person. A missed tag here means a station or the
                  U-turn driven past.
    fault         a mission error the run cannot continue from
    events        (level, text) pairs for the operator, drained by the node

Which reads count:
    departed tag  the stop just left (or, at the first Start, the stop the
                  vehicle is parked past) is suppressed until it has left the
                  antenna field - however slowly the vehicle pulls away
    U-turn re-pass  the U-turn's own tag, driven back over after the pivot, is
                  suppressed once within the approach distance plus a margin
    ignore_s      the table row's window (amr_line.tag_table.TagTable)
    held          reads while stopped or held cannot start a stop or a U-turn

Speed (tracked-speed-plan-1, 2026-10-08; MLS markers since 2026-10-09): NORMAL unless
the high zone (amr_line.speed_zone) grants HIGH. RFID never touches the speed: the
zone is a pair of MLS marker codes, fed by markers() and acted on only while driving,
on a clean read (line good, within MARKER_MAX_LCP2_MM of the tape centre - a pivot
over a marker reads a code off the tape, seen 2026-10-09). The marker stream going
down, or a marker event lost on the way, takes ARMED or HIGH away. With
mls.markers_enabled false a zone mission runs NORMAL and says so.
No RFID tag sets the speed (2026-10-09): a stop parks HIGH and the departure resumes it,
an RFID-link or protective-field hold parks it and the resume restores it
(park_high/resume_high). The U-turn tag is the one exception: the pivot reverses the
vehicle, so the run goes on NORMAL until the markers grant HIGH again. A U-turn, any
other hold or a curve-guard trip takes HIGH away. Every distance it counts is WHEEL
travel handed in by the job (advance()).

Branch tags are honoured held or driving: a branch exit passed during a hold must
still clear its latch.

No mission (or "empty") is plain line following: nothing here ever asks for
anything, and the follower runs at AUTO_RPM with the default branch order.
