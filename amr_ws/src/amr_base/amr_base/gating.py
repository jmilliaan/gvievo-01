"""Command source selection for the mux (spec §2.1, §3.5; unified plan §4.3). Pure, clock-fed.

Authority comes from three places, never from the command streams themselves:
  * the supervisor's ControlLease: instance + generation + allowed classes,
    expiring 0.3 s after local receipt. Under `require_supervisor` nothing is
    selected without a fresh one; a lease from another instance or generation
    is not a lease;
  * the physical panel: selector MANUAL is manual authority, AUTO is the
    executor's; a stale or invalid panel image is no authority at all. Under
    MANUAL the panel image also carries the jog pendant levels, which win over
    every other manual stream while a direction is held;
  * the executor's MotionPermit: FOLLOW or ROTATE, expiring 0.3 s after local
    receipt, honoured only under AUTO, only with the AUTONOMOUS lease class,
    and only if it carries the lease's instance and generation.
The drive owner must also be fresh and operational for anything but zero.
Within an authority a command must still be fresh (0.2 s); a browser
ManualCommand is additionally bounded by the lifetime it carries. Expiry is
zero at once - the mux never lets a ramp extend a command that is gone.

Sequence monotonicity of permit.seq is enforced by the node, which is the thing
that sees the stream. The browser jog stream goes through ManualIntake, which
also owns session revocation (a release is terminal, whatever its seq).
